# To Do List
This is one of my first project using JavaScript. I've tried to make a simple interactive To-Do-List by applying some JavaScript code. The main point of the application
is to write a to do thing, to set the start and end dates, and then just add it to the next row just by pressing the interactive green Add button. 

In case we want to delete one of the rows we can use the other interactive red buttton.

## Lessons Learned

As I mentioned in description, I managed to learn the first steps as a front end developer. I've improved my skills in HTML and CSS. 

A first challenge was to easily display my main titles into three columns and to create the sidebar. I manage to overcome this by using flexbox (display grid & display flexbox). Another challenge was to mantain a nice layout even when narrowing the screen or using a bigger device. I managed to overcome this by using and learning new things about @media.

It was a good starting point to understand the basics of HTML and CSS.

## Optimizations

It was a good starting point to understand the basics of HTML and CSS, and to start some new fun and interesting projects.
