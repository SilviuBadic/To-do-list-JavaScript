# To Do List
This is one of my first projects using JavaScript. I've tried to make a simple interactive To-Do-List by applying some JavaScript code. The main point of the application
is to write a to do thing, to set the start and end dates, and then just add it to the next row by pressing the interactive green Add button. 

In case we want to delete one of the rows we can use the other interactive red Delete buttton. We can select the date by typing the date we want or just by pressing the small
calendar icon and choose from there.

## Features

- A placeholder to enter the to do things
- Start and end dates options
- One interactive green Add button to be pressed after choosing the actual to do thing and dates
- One interactive red Delete button in case we want to delete one of the rows
- The newKeyDown event which let us press Enter after typing the event, which will proceed the same as the green Add Button

## Lessons Learned

The main lesson was to understand how a function works, how to work with events, how to call a function when a specific button is clicked.

I've implemented the for loop, displayed some arrays, I've used DOM for the first time, in order to access and change the elements from the main HTML page.

## Optimizations

It was a good starting point to understand some of the main concepts of JavaScript, to display some simple functions and give my page a bit of dynamism.
